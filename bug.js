This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been fully initialized.  It's especially common in asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API or using a timer.

```javascript
// Incorrect:
const [data, setData] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => setData(data));
}, []);

return (
  <Text>{data.name}</Text> // Possible error here if data is still null
);
```

In this example, `data` is initially `null`. The `useEffect` hook fetches the data, but the component might render before the `setData` function is called, causing a `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')` error.
